      "     To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him\n",
      "     mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and\n",
      "     predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any\n",
      "     emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one\n",
      "     particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably\n",
      "     balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and\n",
      "     observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would\n",
      "     have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer     passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things\n",
      "     for the observer--excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives\n",
      "     and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions\n",
      "     into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to\n",
      "     introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his\n",
      "     mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of\n",
      "     his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong\n",
      "     emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to\n",
      "     him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and\n",
      "     questionable memory.\n",
      "     I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away\n",
      "     from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred\n",
      "     interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master\n",
      "     of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,\n",
      "     while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole\n",
      "     Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among\n",
      "     his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and\n",
      "     ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his\n",
      "     own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study\n",
      "     of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers\n",
      "     of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those\n",
      "     mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official\n",
      "     police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings:\n",
      "     of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his\n",
      "     clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at\n",
      "     Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so\n",
      "     delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.\n",
      "     Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared\n",
      "     with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former\n",
      "     friend and companion.\n",
      "     One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was returning\n",
      "     from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil\n",
      "     practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the\n",
      "     well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with\n",
      "     my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was\n",
      "     seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was\n",
      "     employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit,\n",
      "     and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in\n",
      "     a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly,\n",
      "     eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped\n",
      "     behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude\n",
      "     and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen\n",
      "     out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new\n",
      "     problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had\n",
      "     formerly been in part my own.\n",
      "     His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,\n",
      "     to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved\n",
      "     me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a\n",
      "     spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the\n",
      "     fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.\n",
      "     \"Wedlock suits you,\" he remarked. \"I think, Watson, that you have put\n",
      "     on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.\"\n",
      "     \"Seven!\" I answered.\n",
      "     \"Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I\n",
      "     fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me\n",
      "     that you intended to go into harness.\"\n",
      "     \"Then, how do you know?\"\n",
      "     \"I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting\n",
      "     yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and\n",
      "     careless servant girl?\"\n",
      "     \"My dear Holmes,\" said I, \"this is too much. You would certainly have\n",
      "     been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had\n",
      "     a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I     have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary\n",
      "     Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but\n",
      "     there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.\"\n",
      "     He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.\n",
      "     \"It is simplicity itself,\" said he; \"my eyes tell me that on the\n",
      "     inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the\n",
      "     leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have\n",
      "     been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the\n",
      "     edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you\n",
      "     see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and\n",
      "     that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the\n",
      "     London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my\n",
      "     rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver\n",
      "     upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his\n",
      "     top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be\n",
      "     dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the\n",
      "     medical profession.\"\n",
      "     I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his\n",
      "     process of deduction. \"When I hear you give your reasons,\" I\n",
      "     remarked, \"the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously\n",
      "     simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive\n",
      "     instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your\n",
      "     process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.\"\n",
      "     \"Quite so,\" he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself\n",
      "     down into an armchair. \"You see, but you do not observe. The\n",
      "     distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps\n",
      "     which lead up from the hall to this room.\"\n",
      "     \"Frequently.\"\n",
      "     \"How often?\"\n",
      "     \"Well, some hundreds of times.\"\n",
      "     \"Then how many are there?\"\n",
      "     \"How many? I don't know.\"\n",
      "     \"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just\n",
      "     my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have\n",
      "     both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are interested in these\n",
      "     little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or\n",
      "     two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.\" He\n",
      "     threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been\n",
      "     lying open upon the table. \"It came by the last post,\" said he. \"Read\n",
      "     it aloud.\"\n",
      "     The note was undated, and without either signature or address.\n",
      "     \"There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o'clock,\"\n",
      "     it said, \"a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the\n",
      "     very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses\n",
      "     of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with\n",
      "     matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.\n",
      "     This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your\n",
      "     chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor\n",
      "     wear a mask.\"\n",
      "     \"This is indeed a mystery,\" I remarked. \"What do you imagine that it\n",
      "     means?\"\n",
      "     \"I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one\n",
      "     has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories,\n",
      "     instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you\n",
      "     deduce from it?\"\n",
      "     I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was\n",
      "     written.     \"The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,\" I remarked,\n",
      "     endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. \"Such paper could\n",
      "     not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong\n",
      "     and stiff.\"\n",
      "     \"Peculiar--that is the very word,\" said Holmes. \"It is not an English\n",
      "     paper at all. Hold it up to the light.\"\n",
      "     I did so, and saw a large \"E\" with a small \"g,\" a \"P,\" and a large\n",
      "     \"G\" with a small \"t\" woven into the texture of the paper.\n",
      "     \"What do you make of that?\" asked Holmes.\n",

      "     \"Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for 'Gesellschaft,'\n",
